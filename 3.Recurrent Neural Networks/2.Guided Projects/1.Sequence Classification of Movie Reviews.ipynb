    "Sequence classification is a predictive modeling problem where you have some sequence of inputs over space or time, and the task is to predict a category for the sequence. This problem is difficult because the sequences can vary in length, comprise a very large vocabulary of input symbols, and may require the model to learn the long-term context or dependencies between symbols in the input sequence. In this project, you will discover how you can develop LSTM recurrent neural network models for sequence classification problems in Python using the Keras deep learning library.
