This means that in addition to being used for predictive models (making predictions), they can learn the sequences of a problem and then generate entirely new plausible sequences for the problem domain. Generative models like this are helpful to study how well a model has learned a problem and learn more about the problem domain itself. In this project, you will discover how to create a generative model for text, character-by-character using LSTM recurrent neural networks in Python with Keras.
