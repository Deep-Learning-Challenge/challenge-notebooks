    "A powerful and popular recurrent neural network is the long short-term model network or LSTM. It is widely used because the architecture overcomes the vanishing and exploding gradient problem that plagues all recurrent neural networks, allowing very large and very deep networks to be created. Like other recurrent neural networks, LSTM networks maintain state, and the specifics of how this is implemented in the Keras framework can be confusing. This lesson will show exactly how the state is maintained in LSTM networks by the Keras deep learning library. After reading this lesson, you will know:\n",

Once understood, this is a simple sequence prediction problem that can be generalized to other sequence prediction problems like time series prediction and sequence classification.
