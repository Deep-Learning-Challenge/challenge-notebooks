    "A powerful and popular recurrent neural network is the long short-term model network or LSTM. It is widely used because the architecture overcomes the vanishing and exploding gradient problem that plagues all recurrent neural networks, allowing very large and very deep networks to be created. Like other recurrent neural networks, LSTM networks maintain state, and the specifics of how this is implemented in the Keras framework can be confusing. This lesson will show exactly how the state is maintained in LSTM networks by the Keras deep learning library. After reading this lesson, you will know:\n",

    "In this tutorial, we will develop and contrast a number of different LSTM recurrent neural network models. The context of these comparisons will be a simple sequence prediction problem of learning the alphabet. That is, given a letter of the alphabet, predict the next letter of the alphabet. Once understood, this is a simple sequence prediction problem that can be generalized to other sequence prediction problems like time series prediction and sequence classification. Let's prepare the problem with some Python code that we can reuse from example to example. Firstly, let's import all of the classes and functions we plan to use in this tutorial.\n"

We will frame the problem as a random collection of one-letter input to one-letter output pairs. As we will see, this is a difficult framing of the problem for the LSTM to learn. Let's define an LSTM network with 32 units and an output layer using the softmax activation function for making predictions. Because this is a multiclass classification problem, we can use the log loss function (called `categorical_crossentropy` in Keras), and optimize the network using the ADAM optimization function.

Each input-output pattern is shown to the network in a random order, and the state of the network is reset after each pattern (each batch where each batch contains one pattern). This is an abuse of the LSTM network architecture, treating it like a standard Multilayer Perceptron. Next, let's try a different framing of the problem to provide more sequence to the network from which to learn."
