    "Application checkpointing is a fault tolerance technique for long-running processes. It is an approach where a snapshot of the system's state is taken in case of system failure. If there is a problem, not all is lost. The checkpoint may be used directly or used as the starting point for a new run, picking up where it left off. When training deep learning models, the checkpoint captures the weights of the model. These weights can be used to make predictions as-is or used as the basis for ongoing training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Keras library provides a checkpointing capability by a callback API. The `ModelCheckpoint` callback class allows you to define where to checkpoint the model weights, how the file should be named and under what circumstances to make a checkpoint of the model. The API allows you to specify which metric to monitor, such as loss or accuracy on the training or validation dataset. You can specify whether to look for an improvement in maximizing or minimizing the score. Finally, the filename that you use to store the weights can include variables like the epoch number or metric. The `ModelCheckpoint` instance can then be passed to the training process when calling the model's `fit()` function. Note, you may need to install the `h5py` library."
