    "Models in Keras are defined as a sequence of layers. We create a **Sequential** model and add layers one at a time until we are happy with our network topology. The first thing to get right is to ensure the input layer has the correct number of inputs. This can be specified when creating the first layer with the `input_dim` argument and set it to 8 for the eight input variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we know the number of layers to use and their types? This is a tough question. We can use heuristics, and often the best network structure is found through trial and error experimentation. Generally, you need a network large enough to capture the problem's structure, if that helps at all. In this example, we will use a fully-connected network structure with three layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fully connected layers are defined using the `Dense` class. We can specify the number of neurons in the layer as the first argument and specify the activation function using the `activation` argument. We will use the rectifier (`relu`) activation function on the first two layers and the `sigmoid` activation function in the output layer. It used to be the case that sigmoid and `tanh` activation functions were preferred for all layers. These days, better performance is seen using the rectifier activation function. We use a sigmoid activation function on the output layer to ensure our network output is between 0 and 1 and easy to map to either a probability of class 1 or snap to a hard classification of either class with a default threshold of 0.5. We can piece it all together by adding each layer. The first hidden layer has 12 neurons and expects 8 input variables (e.g. `input_dim=8`). The second hidden layer has eight neurons and finally, the output layer has one neuron to predict the class (onset of diabetes or not)."
