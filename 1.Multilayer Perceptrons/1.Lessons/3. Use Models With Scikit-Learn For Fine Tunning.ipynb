It is a fully-featured library for general-purpose machine learning and provides many utilities useful in developing deep learning models. Not least:\n",

In the example below, we define a function `create_model()` that creates a simple multilayer neural network for the problem.\n",

In this example, we use the scikit-learn `StratifiedKFold` to perform 10-fold stratified cross-validation. This is a resampling technique that can provide a robust estimate of a machine learning model's performance on unseen data. We use the scikit-learn function `cross_val_score()` to evaluate our model using the cross-validation scheme and print the results.\n",
