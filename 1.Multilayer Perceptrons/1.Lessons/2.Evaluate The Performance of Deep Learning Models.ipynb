Ultimately, the best technique is to actually design small experiments and empirically evaluate options using real data.

It also consists of the lower level decisions like the choice of the loss function, activation functions, optimization procedure, and the number of epochs.\n",

    "The gold standard for machine learning model evaluation is `k-fold cross-validation`. It provides a robust estimate of the performance of a model on unseen data. It does this by splitting the training dataset into k subsets, taking turns training models on all subsets except one held out, and evaluating model performance on the held-out validation dataset. The process is repeated until all subsets are allowed to be the held-out validation set. The performance measure is then averaged across all models that are created.\n",

    "Cross-validation is often not used for evaluating deep learning models because of the more significant computational expense. For example, k-fold cross-validation is often used with 5 or 10 folds. As such, 5 or 10 models must be constructed and evaluated, significantly adding to the evaluation time. Nevertheless, when the problem is small enough or if you have sufficient compute resources, k-fold cross-validation can give you a less biased estimate of the performance of your model.\n",

    "In the example below, we use the handy `StratifiedKFold` [class](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.StratifiedKFold.html) from the scikit-learn Python machine learning library to split the training dataset into ten folds. The folds are stratified, meaning that the algorithm attempts to balance each class's number of instances in each fold. The example creates and evaluates ten models using the ten splits of the data and collects all of the scores. The verbose output for each epoch is turned off by passing `verbose=0` to the `fit()` and `evaluate()` functions on the model. The performance is printed for each model, and it is stored. The average and standard deviation of the model performance is then printed at the end of the run to provide a robust estimate of model accuracy."
