    "Deep learning neural networks learn how to map inputs to outputs from examples in a training dataset. The model weights are initialized to small random values and updated via an optimization algorithm to estimate errors on the training dataset. Given the use of small weights in the model and the use of error between predictions and actual values, the scale of inputs and outputs used to train the model is important. Unscaled input variables can result in a slow or unstable learning process, whereas unscaled target variables on regression problems can result in exploding gradients, causing the learning process to fail. Data preparation involves using techniques such as normalization and standardization to rescale input and output variables before training a neural network model. This tutorial will explore how to improve neural network stability and modeling performance by scaling data. After completing this tutorial, you will know:\n",

    "Deep learning neural network models learn a mapping from input variables to an output variable. As such, the scale and distribution of the data may be different for each variable. Input variables may have different units (e.g., feet, kilometers, and hours) that, in turn, may mean the variables have different scales. Differences in the scales across input variables may increase the difficulty of the problem being modeled. An example of this is that large input values (e.g., a spread of hundreds or thousands of units) can result in a model that learns large weight values. A model with large weight values is often unstable, meaning that it may suffer from poor performance during learning and sensitivity to input values resulting in higher generalization error."

If the quantity values are small (near 0-1) and the distribution is limited (e.g., standard deviation near 1), you can perhaps get away with no scaling of the data. Problems can be complex, and it may not be clear how to best scale input data. If in doubt, normalize the input sequence.

Reducing the scale of the target variable will, in turn, reduce the size of the gradient used to update the weights and result in a more stable model and training process.

This requires estimating the mean and standard deviation of the variable and using these estimates to perform the rescaling. It is best practice is to estimate the mean and standard deviation of the training dataset and use these variables to scale the train and test dataset. This is to avoid any data leakage during the model evaluation process.
