    "Neural networks are trained using gradient descent, where the estimate of the error used to update the weights is calculated based on a subset of the training dataset. The number of examples from the training dataset used in the estimate of the error gradient is called the batch size and is an important hyperparameter that influences the dynamics of the learning algorithm. It is important to explore the dynamics of your model to ensure that you're getting the most out of it. In this tutorial, you will discover three different favors of gradient descent and how to explore and diagnose the effect of batch size on the learning process. After completing this tutorial, you will know:\n",

    "Neural networks are trained using the stochastic gradient descent optimization algorithm. This involves using the model's current state to predict, compare the prediction to the actual values, and use the difference as an estimate of the error gradient. This error gradient is then used to update the model weights, and the process is repeated. The error gradient is a statistical estimate. The more training examples used in the estimate, the more accurate this estimate will be and the more likely that the weights of the network will be adjusted to improve the model's performance. The improved estimate of the error gradient comes at the computational cost of using the model to make many more predictions before the estimate can be calculated. In turn, the weights updated."

    "Alternately, using fewer examples results in a less accurate estimate of the error gradient that is highly dependent on the specific training examples used. This results in a noisy estimate that, in turn, results in noisy updates to the model weights, e.g., many updates with perhaps quite different estimates of the error gradient. Nevertheless, these noisy updates can result in faster learning and sometimes a more robust model."

    "The number of training examples used in the estimate of the error gradient is a hyperparameter for the learning algorithm called the batch size, or simply the batch. A batch size of 32 means that 32 samples from the training dataset will be used to estimate the error gradient before the model weights are updated. One training epoch means that the learning algorithm has made one pass through the training dataset (using every example once), where examples were separated into randomly selected batch size groups. Historically, a training algorithm where the batch size is set to the total number of training examples is called batch gradient descent, and a training algorithm where the batch size is set to 1 training example is called stochastic gradient descent or online gradient descent. A configuration of the batch size anywhere in between (e.g., more than 1 example and less than the number of examples in the training dataset) is called minibatch gradient descent.\n",

    "\n",
    "For shorthand, the algorithm is often referred to as stochastic gradient descent regardless of the batch size. Given that very large datasets are often used to train deep learning neural networks, the batch size is rarely set to the size of the training dataset. Smaller batch sizes are used for two main reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Smaller batch sizes are noisy, offering a regularizing effect and lower generalization error.\n",
    "* Smaller batch sizes make it easier to fit one batch's worth of training data in memory (i.e., when using a GPU with access to less local memory than system RAM).\n",
    "\n",
    "A third reason is that the batch size is often set at something small, such as 32 examples, and is not tuned by the practitioner. Small batch sizes such as 32 do work well generally. Nevertheless, the batch size impacts how quickly a model learns and the stability of the learning process. It is an important hyperparameter that should be well understood and tuned by the deep learning practitioner."

In effect, we specify the rate of learning or amount of change to apply to the weights each time we estimate the error gradient and vary the gradient-based accuracy on the number of samples used to estimate it. Holding the learning rate at 0.01 as we did with batch gradient descent, we can set the batch size to 32, a widely adopted default batch size."
