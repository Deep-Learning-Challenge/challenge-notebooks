    "A weighted average ensemble is an approach that allows multiple models to contribute to a prediction in proportion to their trust or estimated performance. A modeling averaging ensemble combines the prediction from each model equally and often results in better performance on average than a given single model. Sometimes there are very good models that we wish to contribute more to an ensemble prediction, and perhaps less skillful models that may be useful but should contribute less to an ensemble prediction. In this tutorial, you will discover how to develop a weighted average ensemble of deep learning neural network models in Python with Keras. After completing this tutorial, you will know:\n",

    "Model averaging is an approach to ensemble learning where each ensemble member contributes an equal amount to the final prediction. In the case of regression, the ensemble prediction is calculated as the average of the member predictions. In the case of predicting a class label, the prediction is calculated as the mode of the member predictions. In the case of predicting a class probability, the prediction can be calculated as the argmax of the summed probabilities for each class label. A limitation of this approach is that each model has an equal contribution to the final prediction made by the ensemble. There is a requirement that all ensemble members have the skill compared to random chance, although some models are known to perform much better or much worse than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "A weighted ensemble is an extension of a model averaging ensemble where the model's performance weights the contribution of each member to the final prediction. The model weights are small positive values, and the sum of all weights equals one, allowing the weights to indicate the percentage of trust or expected performance from each model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniform values for the weights (e.g., $ \\frac{1}{k} $ where k is the number of ensemble members) mean that the weighted ensemble acts as a simple averaging ensemble. There is no analytical solution to finding the weights (we cannot calculate them); instead, the value for the weights can be estimated using either the training dataset or a holdout validation dataset. Finding the weights using the same training set used to fit the ensemble members will likely result in an overfit model. A more robust approach is to use a holdout validation dataset unseen by the ensemble members during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest, perhaps most exhaustive approach would be to grid search weight values between 0 and 1 for each ensemble member. Alternately, an optimization procedure such as a linear solver or gradient descent optimization can be used to estimate the weights using a unit norm weight constraint to ensure that the vector of weights sum to one. Unless the holdout validation dataset is large and representative, a weighted ensemble can overfit compared to a simple averaging ensemble. A simple alternative to adding more weight to a given model without calculating explicit weight coefficients is to add a given model more than once to the ensemble. Although less flexible, it allows a given well-performing model to contribute more than once to a given prediction made by the ensemble."
